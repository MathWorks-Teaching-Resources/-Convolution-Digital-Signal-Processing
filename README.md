**Curriculum Module**  
_Created with R2021a. Compatible with R2021a and later releases._


## Description ##
This package contains _[live scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html)_ and supporting data files centered around the fundamentals of convolution in digital signal processing. These materials are designed to be flexible and can be easily modified to accommodate a variety of teaching and learning methods. Used in a sequence, the live scripts progressively add depth to the topic. However, each script can be easily adapted for standalone use. We include a brief background, interactive illustrations, tasks, reflection questions, application examples, and guided exercises for the different concepts explored.

The instructions inside the live scripts will guide you through the activities and exercises. Get started with each live script by running it one section at a time. To stop running the script or a section midway (for example, when an animation is in progress), use the **Stop** button in the **Run** section of the **Live Editor** tab in the MATLAB toolstrip.
